Technology architecture defines the provider-neutral runtime, deployment, and operations model for FairSpot.

## Migration Status

Core technology direction has been restated from production and technology-layer evidence. It remains `Draft` because hosted smoke evidence, component hardening, backup/restore proof, and customer-ready persistence are not complete.

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime platform | Partial | Dapr-first runtime, service stack, persistence, ingress, and secrets boundaries are stated. |
| Deployment profiles | Partial | Local, NAS/Cloudflare hosted pilot, demo/cloud, and client-owned production profiles are stated. |
| Technology standards | Draft | Approved API, event, runtime, ingress, observability, persistence, and secret-handling standards are stated. |
| Observability | Partial | Logs, metrics, traces, and business audit separation are stated. Retention and hosted evidence remain gaps. |
| Workflow and scheduled work | Partial | Draw workflow and schedule safety are stated. Broader scheduled jobs remain placeholders. |

## Requirement Coverage

Technology Architecture interprets central requirements from [Requirements Management](/architecture/requirements). Requirement ownership stays central; this section records runtime, platform, deployment, observability, backup, and operational consequences.

| Requirement | Technology Interpretation | Impacted Artifacts | Evidence / Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-003 / AR-014 | Hosted public surfaces must be exposed through the selected ingress/WAF profile and proven by smoke evidence. | [Deployment Profiles](/architecture/technology/deployment-profiles), [Observability](/architecture/technology/observability) | Hosted NAS/Cloudflare smoke evidence. |
| AR-009 | Dapr is the preferred runtime boundary for pub/sub, state, workflow, service invocation, secrets, resiliency, mTLS, component scopes, and outbox where supported. | [Runtime Platform](/architecture/technology/runtime-platform) | Hosted-profile Dapr hardening evidence. |
| AR-010 | Scheduled Draw and other recurring jobs must use deterministic keys and idempotent acquisition so multiple replicas do not execute the same work repeatedly. | [Runtime Platform](/architecture/technology/runtime-platform), [Deployment Profiles](/architecture/technology/deployment-profiles) | Workflow execution diagram and multi-instance test evidence. |
| AR-011 / AR-013 | Customer and DataHub persistence must be restart-safe and suitable for hosted pilot operation. | [Runtime Platform](/architecture/technology/runtime-platform), [Deployment Profiles](/architecture/technology/deployment-profiles) | Customer durable store and DataHub PostgreSQL projection store. |
| AR-017 / AR-020 | Resource-map publication, policy-impact preview, and DataHub projections require restart-safe stores, event reliability, and observable projection health. | [Runtime Platform](/architecture/technology/runtime-platform), [Observability](/architecture/technology/observability) | Configuration publication evidence and DataHub projection health. |

## Operations Boundary

Technology architecture defines the target platform responsibilities and acceptance gates. Operational runbooks remain under `production/` until a separate operations repository structure is approved.

| Operational Area | Architecture Responsibility | Runbook / Evidence Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local validation | Define local profile capabilities and smoke expectations. | [Local Test Harness](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/production/local-test-harness), [Testing Scenarios](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/production/testing-scenarios) |
| NAS/Cloudflare hosted pilot | Define ingress, WAF, private service, Dapr, storage, observability, and smoke gates. | [NAS Cloudflare Deployment Profile](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/production/nas-cloudflare-deployment-profile), [Hosted Smoke Runbook](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/production/hosted-smoke-runbook) |
| Backup and restore | Define recoverability classes, target assets, and evidence gates. | [Backup And Restore](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/production/backup-restore), [RTO/RPO Requirements](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/production/rto-rpo-requirements) |
| Maintenance | Define recurring runtime/platform responsibilities. | [Maintenance](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/production/maintenance) |
| Mobile testing | Define release gate relationship to hosted API/auth readiness. | [Mobile Device Testing](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/production/mobile-device-testing) |

## Legacy Evidence Disposition

| Legacy Source | Target Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `technology-layer/**` | Source evidence for stack and service package history. Target runtime/deployment direction belongs here. |
| `production/**` | Operational runbooks and profile-specific evidence remain source evidence until the deployment/operations repository shape is mature enough to absorb them cleanly. |
| `production/dapr-first-production-standards.md` | Migrated directionally into [Runtime Platform](/architecture/technology/runtime-platform); keep as implementation/hardening source evidence. |
| `production/nas-cloudflare-deployment-profile.md` | Migrated directionally into [Deployment Profiles](/architecture/technology/deployment-profiles); keep as operational profile detail. |
| Local observability and smoke runbooks | Remain operational evidence linked from Technology and Security until hosted evidence is complete. |
