## Evidence Needed Before Hosted Pilot

- Cloudflare/WAF rules applied or exported for the public domain.
- Origin scan or smoke evidence showing internal paths are not public.
- OIDC public-domain redirect/CORS/cookie validation.
- Dapr sidecar/component access hardening evidence for the selected profile.
- Dapr component scopes, secret scopes, resiliency policies, state encryption support, and sidecar/API token settings reviewed for the selected profile.
- Tenant-scoped persistence restart test for P0 state.
- Backup/restore drill evidence for authoritative state or an accepted hosted-pilot waiver.
- Log/trace sample review showing no secrets or raw confidential payloads.
- Audit record sample for privileged Draw/cancellation and PII mapping access where applicable.
- Role-safe DataHub projection samples for HR support, sponsor summaries, and resource-map publication views.
