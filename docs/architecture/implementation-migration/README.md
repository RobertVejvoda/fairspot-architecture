Implementation and Migration turns FairSpot architecture gaps into sequenced work packages, roadmap increments, and readiness evidence.

FairSpot is currently in the **Customer-Ready Pilot** transition: the product story is coherent, but hosted pilot readiness still depends on durable state, DataHub projections, hosted profile evidence, role-centered UX validation, contract evidence, and diagram refresh.

## Migration Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Customer-ready first | Work is sequenced around deployable customer evaluation, not broad enterprise completeness. |
| Evidence over assertion | Gaps close only when linked to implementation, runbook, contract, or review evidence. |
| Keep Billing deferred | Billing remains visible but outside customer-first deployability. |
| Slice by outcome | Architecture increments should own a useful business, data, platform, security, or operations outcome from trigger to evidence. |

## Requirement Coverage

Implementation and Migration interprets central requirements from [Requirements Management](/architecture/requirements) as transition states, work packages, readiness evidence, release checks, accepted risks, or deferred gaps.

| Requirement | Implementation / Migration Interpretation | Impacted Artifacts | Evidence / Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-011 / AR-013 | Customer durable state and DataHub projections are transition work packages before customer-ready hosted evaluation. | [Roadmap](/architecture/implementation-migration/roadmap), [Work Packages](/architecture/implementation-migration/work-packages), [Readiness](/architecture/implementation-migration/readiness) | Customer persistence evidence exists; DataHub projections and health remain active gaps. |
| AR-014 / AR-021 / AR-022 | Hosted smoke, backup/restore, Dapr hardening, and operational evidence must be validated or accepted as residual risk during Release 1. | [Readiness](/architecture/implementation-migration/readiness), [Risk Register](/architecture/architecture-states/risk-register), [Architecture Roadmap](/architecture/implementation-migration/roadmap) | Release 1 validation issue tracks pass/fail/residual risk. |
| AR-006 / AR-007 / AR-008 / AR-024 | Role-centered UX, Draw visibility/progress, HR cancellation, and role-safe outputs become release validation checks or follow-up issues. | [Roadmap](/architecture/implementation-migration/roadmap), [Work Packages](/architecture/implementation-migration/work-packages), [Readiness](/architecture/implementation-migration/readiness) | Draw schedule is merged; Draw progress, HR operations, and role-safe output review remain open. |
| AR-015 | Billing remains deferred and must not block Release 1 or customer-first deployability. | [Roadmap](/architecture/implementation-migration/roadmap), [Work Packages](/architecture/implementation-migration/work-packages) | No release work unless a commercial decision changes. |
