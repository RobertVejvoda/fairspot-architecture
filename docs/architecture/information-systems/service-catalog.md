## Service Ownership Rules

- Service criticality does not imply that DataHub may own command state.
- Deferred services stay visible so diagrams do not imply accidental deletion.
- In-memory repositories are not customer-ready for P0 tenant or operational state.
- Services must expose tenant-scoped APIs and events; tenant IDs cannot be caller supplied for authenticated commands.

## Visible Service Gaps

- Customer primary stores are Dapr-backed (DATA010); remaining gap is Notification, Audit, Reporting, Profile, and Configuration persistence.
- DataHub needs event inbox, read-model store, projection health, and first query APIs.
- Configuration needs customer-ready resource-map publication APIs/events and validation evidence.
- DataHub needs HR support summary, policy-impact preview, resource-map publication summary, and sponsor management summary projections.
- Reporting needs a keep/remove/re-scope decision once DataHub is established.
- Feedback and Billing remain deferred.
