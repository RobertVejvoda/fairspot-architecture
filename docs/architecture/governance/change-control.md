# Change Control

| Change Type | Review Needed | Decision Record Needed | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minor clarification | Normal docs review | No | No behavior or architecture change. |
| New target architecture statement | Architecture review | Usually | Record if durable or controversial. |
| New service/data/integration boundary | Architecture review | Yes | Update Information Systems and gap analysis. |
| Security/privacy-impacting change | Architecture and security review | Yes | Include risk acceptance if not fully mitigated. |
| Deployment profile change | Architecture and operations review | Usually | Update Technology and Security pages. |
| Waiver to principle/control | Architecture board review | Yes | Include review or expiry date. |

## Change Sources

| Source | Handling |
| --- | --- |
| Chat requirement | If architecture-significant, record it first as a requirement, constraint, decision, risk, target-state note, or gap before routing implementation. |
| Architecture requirement | Treat as durable intent. Use it to derive one or more delivery issues. |
| GitHub issue | Treat as delivery source of truth when it has architecture references, scope, acceptance criteria, validation, owner, and implementer where relevant. |
| Pull request | Review against linked issue, affected architecture artifacts, validation evidence, and known gaps. |
| Architecture decision | Record durable changes in [Versions and Decisions](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/versions-and-decisions). |
| Customer or security finding | Record the finding, affected artifact, risk owner, and whether it is a blocker, gap, waiver, or follow-up slice. |

## Traceability Rules

- Architecture pages define durable intent and governance state.
- GitHub issues implement that intent in smaller, testable slices.
- PRs provide implementation and validation evidence.
- Every architecture-significant issue should include an `Architecture refs` section with relevant `AR-###`, `GAP-###`, `RISK-###`, `CON-###`, or `ADR-###` IDs.
- Every merged architecture-significant PR should leave enough evidence for the linked architecture requirement or gap to be updated.
- Avoid copying full issue acceptance criteria back into architecture pages. Link the issue instead.

## Routing Rules

- Routine implementation goes through issues and PRs.
- Architecture-significant changes update the relevant `docs/architecture/` artifact in the same PR or a linked docs PR.
- Labels do not own workflow state; Project fields `Status`, `Owner`, and `Implementer` are the durable workflow signals.
- A merged PR closes the implementation loop only when validation evidence is recorded and linked issues are moved to `Done`.

## Robert TODOs

- Robert TODO: confirm when architecture updates may be merged directly versus requiring a separate review branch and PR.
- Robert TODO: confirm how formal customer change requests should be represented if a pilot customer starts giving feedback.
