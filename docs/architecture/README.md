# Architecture Repository

This section is the new lightweight TOGAF 10-inspired architecture repository for FairSpot.

It is intentionally separate from the older layer-based documentation. Existing pages under `business-layer/`, `application-layer/`, `technology-layer/`, `security/`, `production/`, and the delivery trackers remain source evidence until their content is migrated or superseded. New architecture governance and target-state content should be added under `docs/architecture/`.

FairSpot primarily models target architecture. The baseline is current-state evidence: implemented product behavior, current documentation, deployment assumptions, and known gaps. Baseline evidence exists to support gap analysis; it is not treated as a complete enterprise baseline architecture.

## Rules

- Keep new architecture content under `docs/architecture/`.
- Treat older layer pages as source evidence, not as the target architecture repository structure.
- Treat [Legacy Architecture Evidence](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/architecture-views) as a bridge to old view hierarchy evidence, not as a current architecture entry point.
- Use Docsify absolute links (`/path/to/page`) inside nested pages so local and hosted routes behave the same.
- Treat page status and version as artifact metadata, not as a replacement for Git history.
- Mark assumptions and current-state evidence clearly when a complete baseline does not exist.
- Keep missing layers visible as placeholders instead of leaving readers to infer gaps from legacy documentation.
- Use [Enterprise Continuum](/architecture/enterprise-continuum/) to distinguish FairSpot product architecture from the fictive FairSpot Operator enterprise architecture.
