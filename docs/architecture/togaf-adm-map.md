# TOGAF ADM Map

This page maps FairSpot documentation to TOGAF ADM areas. The mapping is intentionally lightweight: it makes coverage and validation explicit without forcing every TOGAF artifact.

Formal TOGAF deliverables are mapped in [TOGAF Deliverable Coverage](/architecture/artifact-register?id=togaf-deliverable-coverage). FairSpot creates standalone deliverable pages only when the content does not have a natural home elsewhere.

## Validation Gate Pattern

An artifact can move from `Draft` to `Approved` or `Baselined` when:

- stakeholder concerns are addressed;
- assumptions and open questions are listed;
- security, privacy, and operational impact are considered;
- affected decisions are recorded;
- baseline-to-target gaps are linked where relevant;
- Robert or the accountable architecture owner accepts the artifact.

## FairSpot Tailoring

FairSpot is a greenfield product, not a classic enterprise estate transformation. The target architecture is the main model. Baseline architecture is represented by current-state evidence and implemented-state snapshots rather than a full baseline architecture document.

Legacy layer pages remain source evidence until their content is migrated or superseded by pages under `docs/architecture/`.

## Enterprise Continuum Placement

The [Enterprise Continuum](/architecture/enterprise-continuum/) is used as a learning and classification guide. It separates reusable architecture assets, reusable solution building blocks, FairSpot product architecture, and the fictive FairSpot Operator enterprise architecture.

## Roadmap And Operations Placement

| Artifact | TOGAF Placement | FairSpot Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Roadmap](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/roadmap) | Phases E/F | Business-readable sequencing remains product-level, while architecture work packages and target states are controlled in [Implementation And Migration](/architecture/implementation-migration/) and [Transition Architectures](/architecture/implementation-migration/transition-architectures). |
| [Operations Runbooks](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/production) | Phases D/G | Runbooks are not target architecture definitions by themselves. They provide implementation-governance evidence for deployment, smoke, backup/restore, observability, incidents, and Dapr hardening. |
| [Product Strategy Source Evidence](https://robertvejvoda.github.io/fairspot/#/strategy) | Phase A source evidence | Strategy is not a separate public architecture layer. It feeds Architecture Vision, Principles, Roadmap, Commercialisation, and durable decisions. |
