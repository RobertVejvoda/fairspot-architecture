# Architecture Artifact Register

This register tracks the status, version, ownership, and review state of FairSpot architecture artifacts.

## Artifact Metadata Standard

Top-level pages inside the Architecture Repository should use this header when they become governed artifacts. Detailed child pages, including Architecture State detail pages, are tracked from this register instead of repeating the metadata block on every page.

| **Baseline Version** | Current State v0.1 |
| **Target Version** | Customer-Ready Target v0.1 |
| **ADM Phase** | Preliminary / A / B / C / D / E / F / G / H / Requirements Management |
| **Responsible** | Architecture Owner |

## TOGAF Deliverable Coverage

FairSpot does not create a separate page for every formal TOGAF deliverable when the mandatory content is covered naturally elsewhere. This matrix records where that content lives and makes missing coverage explicit.

| TOGAF Deliverable / Content Area | FairSpot Coverage | Coverage Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture Repository | [Architecture Repository](/architecture/), [Artifact Register](/architecture/artifact-register), [Architecture Migration Tracker](/architecture/migration-tracker) | Partial | Repository structure exists. Content migration and diagram refresh continue. |

| Request for Architecture Work | [Architecture Vision](/architecture/architecture-vision), [Requirements](/architecture/requirements), [Constraints](/architecture/constraints), [Architecture Migration Tracker](/architecture/migration-tracker) | Partial | Intent, scope, constraints, strategy translation, and migration slices are covered; no standalone document needed unless an external customer asks for it. |
| Statement of Architecture Work | [Architecture Vision](/architecture/architecture-vision), [Governance](/architecture/governance/), [Architecture States](/architecture/architecture-states/), [Gap Analysis](/architecture/architecture-states/gap-analysis), [Risk Register](/architecture/architecture-states/risk-register) | Partial | Scope, constraints, approach, non-goals, risks, deliverable coverage, and governance links are covered; approval evidence remains open. |
