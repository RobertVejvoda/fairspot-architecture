FairSpot business architecture describes the parking-first fair allocation operating model. The target business state is a transparent, auditable booking and Draw process that reduces HR/facilities coordination work while keeping employees informed.

## Migration Status

Core business architecture has been restated from legacy business-layer evidence into this repository. It is still `Draft` because diagram refresh, customer validation, and transition-state gap closure are not complete.

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capabilities | Partial | Customer-ready parking capabilities are stated. Billing remains deferred. |
| Value streams | Partial | Core tenant, employee, HR, audit, and deployment value streams are stated. Detailed ArchiMate diagrams are still placeholders. |
| Actors and roles | Partial | Primary operating roles are stated. RACI remains governed separately. |
| Business processes | Partial | Customer-first parking flows are migrated. Some implementation gaps remain in Customer persistence, HR/admin operations, and durable DataHub projections. |
| Policies | Partial | Allocation, lifecycle, notification, privacy, and deferred-scope policies are stated. Tenant-specific policy configuration still needs implementation validation. |

## Legacy Business Evidence Categorization

| Legacy Source | New Target Location | Migration Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `business-layer/requirements.md` | [Architecture Requirements](/architecture/requirements), [Capabilities](/architecture/business/capabilities), [Value Streams](/architecture/business/value-streams) | Business goals and customer-ready requirements are restated. Detailed implementation acceptance criteria remain source evidence until linked to issues. |
| `business-layer/personas.md`, `business-layer/roles.md`, `business-layer/role-intent-roadmap.md` | [Stakeholders and Concerns](/architecture/stakeholders-and-concerns), [Actors and Roles](/architecture/business/actors-roles) | Primary actors, role-specific default views, and concerns are restated. |
| `business-layer/business-process-flows.md` | [Business Processes](/architecture/business/business-processes), [Value Streams](/architecture/business/value-streams) | Operational sequence is restated at target business level. Detailed legacy flow remains source evidence until diagrams are refreshed. |
| `business-layer/allocation-rules.md`, `booking-request-lifecycle.md`, `booking-reason-codes.md`, `parking-policy-configuration.md` | [Business Processes](/architecture/business/business-processes), [Policies](/architecture/business/policies), later Information Systems contracts | Business rules are summarized here. Executable rule details remain implementation contracts until migrated into API/event/domain contract artifacts. |
| `business-layer/customer.md`, `tenant-onboarding.md`, `customer-data-import.md` | [Capabilities](/architecture/business/capabilities), [Business Processes](/architecture/business/business-processes), [Information Systems](/architecture/information-systems/) | Customer/tenant onboarding is partially migrated. Durable tenant storage remains a visible architecture gap. |
| `business-layer/reporting.md` | [Capabilities](/architecture/business/capabilities), [Data Architecture](/architecture/information-systems/data-architecture) | Reporting is reframed as DataHub-backed operational insight. Reporting-as-durable-projection-store is obsolete. |
| `business-layer/billing.md` | Deferred scope in this page and [Migration Tracker](/architecture/migration-tracker) | Billing remains visible but excluded from customer-ready target. |
| `business-layer/feedback.md` | Pilot feedback capability and future support process | Narrow authenticated pilot feedback remains optional P2; broad support portal remains deferred. |

## Requirement Coverage

Business Architecture interprets central requirements from [Requirements Management](/architecture/requirements). The requirement ID, lifecycle, and ownership stay central; this section records business impact, affected artifacts, and evidence gaps.

| Requirement | Business Interpretation | Impacted Artifacts | Evidence / Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-001 | Tenant boundaries must be visible in roles, processes, policies, HR/facilities actions, and customer onboarding flows. | [Actors and Roles](/architecture/business/actors-roles), [Business Processes](/architecture/business/business-processes), [Policies](/architecture/business/policies) | HR/support privileged actions still need customer-ready validation evidence. |
| AR-004 / AR-007 | Employees need safe, understandable booking, allocation, and next-Draw schedule information without lottery internals. | [Value Streams](/architecture/business/value-streams), [Business Processes](/architecture/business/business-processes), [Policies](/architecture/business/policies) | Draw schedule is merged; Draw progress and final role-specific validation remain. |
| AR-008 | HR/facilities cancellation is a controlled business process, not a raw data edit. It requires authorization, reason capture, audit, and employee notification where affected. | [Business Processes](/architecture/business/business-processes), [Policies](/architecture/business/policies), [Actors and Roles](/architecture/business/actors-roles) | HR operations workspace and cancellation evidence remain open. |
| AR-017 / AR-020 | Facilities resource-map publication and policy-impact preview must be governed business actions before they affect allocation. | [Capabilities](/architecture/business/capabilities), [Business Processes](/architecture/business/business-processes), [Policies](/architecture/business/policies) | Resource-map publication and impact-preview slices remain future scope. |
| AR-019 | Sponsors need aggregate business-value evidence by default, not employee-level operational detail. | [Capabilities](/architecture/business/capabilities), [Value Streams](/architecture/business/value-streams), [Policies](/architecture/business/policies) | Sponsor-safe metrics and aggregation rules remain a DataHub/read-model gap. |

## Robert TODOs

- Robert TODO: confirm which business process diagrams must be redrawn before external customer review.
- Robert TODO: confirm whether broad customer support remains deferred or whether a narrow customer-service process is needed before pilot.
- Robert TODO: confirm whether motorcycle-specific capacity remains future scope for v1 customer demos.
