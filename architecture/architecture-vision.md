FairSpot is an open-source, parking-first fair allocation platform for companies where demand for shared workplace resources exceeds supply.

## Problem

Companies with limited parking often coordinate requests through email, spreadsheets, or informal priority rules. That creates avoidable HR/facilities work, low transparency, weak auditability, and low employee trust.

## Target Outcome

FairSpot provides a transparent request and Draw process with role-appropriate user experiences, auditable allocation rules, tenant-scoped data, and a deployment model that can run locally, in a hosted pilot, or in a customer-owned environment.

The customer-ready target is not a full enterprise architecture baseline. It is the minimum coherent target architecture needed to let a customer, HR/facilities stakeholder, client IT reviewer, and security reviewer understand whether FairSpot is credible for a hosted demo or pilot.

## Product Strategy Translation

FairSpot's strategy is expressed through the product overview, roadmap, commercialisation notes, durable decisions, and architecture repository. The architecture vision translates that strategy into reviewable target-state constraints.

| Product Direction | Architecture Translation |
| --- | --- |
| Parking first | Business, application, data, technology, and security architecture are scoped to parking v1. Generic scarce-resource abstractions are future options, not current target scope. |
| Small-company pilot first | The customer-ready target optimizes for a realistic tenant, initially below about 150 employees, with visible parking friction and manageable support complexity. |
| Trust before scale | Employee-visible explanations, HR/facility auditability, tenant isolation, privacy, and hosted smoke evidence are required before larger rollout. |
| Open core remains useful | Fairness rules, normal tenant operation, basic reporting/read-model evidence, audit, and privacy controls must remain usable without paid unlocks. |
| Paid services before product Billing | Setup, support, production readiness, and client-specific integration may be commercial paths; in-product Billing and payment remain deferred. |
| Client-owned production is credible | Dapr, OpenTelemetry, documented deployment profiles, and runbooks must support client-owned operation without binding the product to one provider. |

## Architecture Scope

| Scope Item | Target Position | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product domain | Parking-first fair allocation for scarce workplace resources. Other resources are future extensions. | Draft |
| Customer readiness | Demonstrable employee, HR/facilities, tenant admin, audit, and operator journeys with explicit gaps. | Draft |
| Pilot fit | First external evaluation should target a small or medium company with visible parking scarcity before larger enterprise rollout. | Draft |
| Deployment posture | Local development, hosted demo, and client-owned production profiles with Dapr/OpenTelemetry portability boundaries. | Draft |
| Data architecture | Service-owned writes and event-fed DataHub read models for cross-service reads. | Draft |
| Security posture | Tenant isolation, SSO-first identity, auditability, privacy, WAF/ingress hardening, and secrets separation. | Draft |
| Commercial scope | Billing and payment are visible future capabilities, not customer-first dependencies. | Deferred |

## Goals

- Make the employee booking and allocation outcome understandable.
- Make HR/facility operation repeatable and auditable.
- Keep tenant identity and data boundaries explicit.
- Use Dapr-first provider-neutral runtime contracts where they fit.
- Keep the free/open core strong enough for a normal tenant to evaluate fairness, auditability, and operations.
- Prepare enough architecture evidence for customer and client IT evaluation.
- Keep architecture content separated by target, current evidence, gaps, and transition work.

## Success Measures

| Measure | Customer-Ready Expectation |
| --- | --- |
| Employee trust | Employee can request, see status, understand outcome, cancel where allowed, and receive notifications without seeing hidden Draw internals. |
| HR/facilities usability | HR can see what needs attention, understand next Draw timing, trigger an authorized Draw where allowed, cancel any tenant-scoped request with reason, and rely on audit/notification evidence. |
| Tenant administration | Administrator can see readiness, identity/profile/policy/location/storage gaps, and avoid exposing technical tenant concepts to employee workflows. |
| Operational confidence | Operator can see deployment profile, Dapr component health, observability, backup/restore expectations, WAF boundary, and hosted smoke evidence. |
| Architecture governance | Draft, approved, deferred, and missing architecture artifacts are visible in the repository and trace to delivery gaps. |
| Commercial restraint | Customer evaluation does not depend on Billing, paid-only fairness, or hidden operational features. |

## Non-Goals

- Billing and commercial enforcement are not part of the customer-ready target.
- Large-enterprise rollout is not part of the first customer-ready target.
- A full enterprise baseline model is not required for FairSpot v1.
- Provider-specific deployment products are examples or profiles, not core architecture.
- Reporting-as-a-service-owned PostgreSQL direction is not the target. Cross-service read models belong in DataHub; Reporting may remain only as catalog/configuration/presentation if needed.

## Statement Of Architecture Work Coverage

FairSpot does not maintain a separate Statement of Architecture Work document for this phase. The mandatory content is covered here and in linked repository pages.

| Content Area | Covered By | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope and objective | This page, [Architecture States](/architecture/architecture-states/), [Target Architecture](/architecture/architecture-states/target-architecture) | Draft |
| Constraints | This page, [Principles](/architecture/principles), [Security Architecture](/architecture/security/) | Draft |
| Stakeholders and concerns | [Stakeholders and Concerns](/architecture/stakeholders-and-concerns), [Actors and Roles](/architecture/business/actors-roles) | Draft |
| Work packages and gaps | [Gap Analysis](/architecture/architecture-states/gap-analysis), [Transition Architectures](/architecture/architecture-states/transition-architectures), delivery board issues | Partial |
| Governance and approval | [Governance](/architecture/governance/), [Artifact Lifecycle](/architecture/governance/artifact-lifecycle), [Architecture Review](/architecture/governance/architecture-review) | Draft |

## Robert TODOs

- Robert TODO: confirm the first customer-ready pilot scope and what must be shown live versus documented as a known gap.
- Robert TODO: confirm whether the hosted public-domain profile on NAS plus Cloudflare is acceptable for the first customer-facing demo.
- Robert TODO: provide or approve the refreshed application cooperation diagram that includes Booking, Configuration, Customer, Notification, Audit, DataHub, Reporting, and Dapr integration boundaries.
- Robert TODO: confirm which DataHub projections are mandatory before the first customer evaluation.
- Robert TODO: confirm which architecture artifacts require formal approval before sharing externally.

## Success Criteria

- Architecture Board accepts the target scope, principles, requirements, and major decisions.
- Gap analysis has owners, impacts, and work packages for material gaps.
- Implementation governance can verify delivery evidence against requirements, controls, and readiness criteria.
